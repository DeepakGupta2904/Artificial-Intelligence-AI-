Project: - Binary Classification on ‘Customer_Churn’ using Keras.

I am done this project at Intellipaat Solution Pvt. Ltd. as an Trainee.

In this project, I am utilizing predictive analysis to assess the factors responsible for a customer leaving the company. Churn prediction models aid in identifying the customer base most likely to churn out, where "churn" refers to customers ceasing business with the company. This is particularly relevant in industries like telecom.
